### BREAKING CHANGES

#### [#448] [Translation] add abstract class support

Given three classes:
- `AbstractEntity` (translatable)
- `AbstractEntityTranslation` (translation)
- `TheEntity` which extends `AbstractEntity`

`TheEntity::getTranslationEntityClass()` now resolves to `YourEntityTranslation` instead of `AbstractEntityTranslation`.

You can either: 
- create a `YourEntityTranslation` class (recommended)
- use the old way, re-implement `AbstractEntity#getTranslationEntityClass()` to return `self::class.'Translation'`
